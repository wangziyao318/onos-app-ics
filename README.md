# onos-app-ics

A template of ONOS app component generated by Maven using [onos-api 2.7.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.onosproject/onos-api/2.7.0). This is only a template with basic file structures of an app component. Start here to programme your own ONOS apps.

- Refer to the [central Maven repository](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/onosproject/) for sample app components. For example, the [onos-app-forward](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/onosproject/onos-app-fwd/1.6.0/). However, since these sample codes are too old (e.g., ver 1.6.0), some expressions may change in new ONOS APIs.

```sh
# mvn is Maven executable file
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.onosproject -DarchetypeArtifactId=onos-bundle-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=2.7.0
```
